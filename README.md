# Football Team Performance Analysis Using SNA
## Project Overview
This project applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) to study the interactions and performance dynamics of a football team across two halves of a match. By examining how players connect and influence the game through passing, we gain insights into the team's tactical execution and player significance.

## Data
The analysis is based on pass data collected during a professional football match. The data includes:

Player IDs

Matrix of the pass to understand who pass to who and how often

## Notebooks and .Html file
FirstHalf: Analyzes the team's network structure and player roles in the first half of the match.

SecondHalf: Continues the analysis into the second half, discussing the effects of tactical changes and player substitutions.

## Analysis Highlights
Centrality Measures: Explore how different players contribute to the team's strategy using degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.

Network Dynamics: Visualize the team's passing network to understand the flow of the game and identify key players.

Comparative Insights: Assess how the team's performance evolves from the first to the second half, with a focus on strategic adjustments.

## Tools Used
NetworkX: For constructing and analyzing networks.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to display network and centrality metrics.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
