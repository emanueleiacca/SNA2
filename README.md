# Football Team Performance Analysis Using SNA
## Project Overview
This project applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) to study the interactions and performance dynamics of a football team across two halves of a match. By examining how players connect and influence the game through passing, we gain insights into the team's tactical execution and player significance.

## Notebooks
FirstHalf.ipynb: Analyzes the team's network structure and player roles in the first half of the match.
SecondHalf.ipynb: Continues the analysis into the second half, discussing the effects of tactical changes and player substitutions.

## Analysis Highlights
Centrality Measures: Explore how different players contribute to the team's strategy using degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.
Network Dynamics: Visualize the team's passing network to understand the flow of the game and identify key players.
Comparative Insights: Assess how the team's performance evolves from the first to the second half, with a focus on strategic adjustments.
